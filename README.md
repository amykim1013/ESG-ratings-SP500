# ESG Ratings and Stock Prices: An Analysis of S&P 500 Companies

## Project Overview
This project investigates the correlation between ESG ratings and stock prices for S&P 500 companies using data collected from Yahoo Finance. The analysis focuses on the 'Total-score' of Sustainalytics' ESG ratings and excludes 56 stocks missing from the sustainability analysis. 

## Data Processing
Data was processed to address inconsistencies in Sustainalytics' ratings calculation method, and Min-Max normalization was conducted to standardize the ratings on a common scale of 0 to 100.

## Analysis
The analysis shows a positive correlation between changes in ESG rating and changes in stock prices for most companies, although this may be due to correlation rather than causation. The absolute value of correlation varies by stocks, with some companies having a significantly higher correlation due to multiple scandals or incidents.

## Conclusion
The project provides insights into the correlation between ESG ratings and stock prices for S&P 500 companies, but further research is needed to identify causation.
